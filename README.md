# Code Refactor Starter Code

- I changed all the div elements to semantic elements to better describe what the div container was. I then had to match the css code to the new element names.

- I added an ID for a corresponding anchor tag to fix a broken link in the nav element.

- I made sure both HTML and CSS followed a logical progression in the same way the page was laid out. The HTML page did not seem to need much re-ordering but I did move some groups of classes to be sure they were grouped together with others that targeted the same elements.

- I made comments to better identify what section of code applied to which section of the website.

- I updated the title to be the "Company Name" so that it appears on the browser tab at the top.
